# Circle of Fifths
## interactive circle of  fifths for  educational purposes

This repo is for the software part of a DIY project I am currently doing in my free time for a 3D printed interactive circle of fiths. I am doing it as a fun way to internalize the circle of fifths as part of my music theory studies. The final goal is to make a device that can output:

- all notes berlonging to the selected key
- all chords belonging to the selected key
- graphically mark (colour lights) the chord quality of each individual chord (major, minor, diminished, augmented) 
- graphically mark the notes belonging to a selected chord, according to the chord type formula


Currently the code is in its pre-development stage and is only available as a python prototype. When I am satisfied with the functionality of the prototype, I will rewrite it in C++ and use it with an Arduino to power my device. Perhaps I will provide a link to the CAD data for it as well, in case someone wants to build it.

## Features
currently: 
 - pass a musical key as an input argument to the console and in return get 
 the notes belonging to that key
 - currently the chord qualities only for the major scales are implemented

to be developed: 
- chord qualities for other scales
- c++ implementation
